       <p>  GoLocal facilitates your desire to see the world through someone else's eyes. It does this by connecting you
            with a new kind of guides. They are people who live in the cities you are visiting and know it as the back of their hand.
            They are here to offer you an authentic experience, to help you distance yourself from the standard idea of a tourist
            and allow you immerse yourself into the mistery and excitement of a new place. They help you wander off the
            beaten path, they help you <b>GoLocal</b>.</p>
